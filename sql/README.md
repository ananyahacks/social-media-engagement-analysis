# SQL Scripts

This folder contains SQL scripts used for database setup, data modeling, and analytical queries for the Social Media Engagement, Growth & Sentiment Analysis project.

## Files
- `schema_and_setup.sql` — Database schema creation, data type standardization, normalization of the raw dataset into relational tables, and initial data setup.
- `02_kpi_analysis.sql` — Core KPI and performance analysis queries, including platform-level engagement, content category performance, and sentiment-based engagement analysis using multi-table JOINs.
- `03_time_and_growth_analysis.sql` — Time-based and growth-focused analysis, including monthly engagement trends, platform growth comparison, day-of-week performance, and reach vs engagement evaluation.


Additional analysis scripts (time trends, campaign analysis, and advanced insights) will be added as the project progresses.
